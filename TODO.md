## P1
- n,p to go between 1-second gaps of silence

## P2
- webm to mp3: https://github.com/Kagami/ffmpeg.js/
- mp3 to mp4: https://github.com/muaz-khan/Ffmpeg.js/blob/master/webm-to-mp4.html
- denoise: https://hila.sh/2019/11/20/airpods.html

## Done
- up, down for going between startIndices.
- Add shortcuts to trim, go back a few seconds and then replay and then record.
- Rounding after rough binary search.
- Cache audio buffer (with a specified window) so that the waveform of a smaller window during replay can re-use the result.
